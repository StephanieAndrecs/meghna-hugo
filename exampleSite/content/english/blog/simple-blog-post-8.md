Spinach provides many health benefits for very few calories.

About 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of raw spinach contain 2.7 mg of iron, or 15% of the DV (7).

Although this is non-heme iron, which isn't absorbed very well, spinach is also rich in vitamin C.

This is important since vitamin C significantly boosts iron absorption (8).

Spinach is also rich in antioxidants called carotenoids that may reduce your risk of cancer, decrease inflammation, and protect your eyes from disease (9, 10, 11, 12).

Consuming spinach and other leafy greens with fat helps your body absorb the carotenoids, so make sure to eat a healthy fat like olive oil with your spinach (13).

**SUMMARY** Spinach provides 15% of the DV for iron per serving, along with several vitamins and minerals. It also contains important antioxidants.
